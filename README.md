# Assignment 1, 2nd part.

This assignment is focusing on test-driven development, TDD, with the use of tools like XUnit and Moq. I also used Coverlet for test coverage along the process.

***XUnit***     : https://xunit.github.io/

***Moq***       : https://github.com/moq/moq4

***Coverlet***  : https://github.com/tonerdo/coverlet/?WT.mc_id=-blog-scottha



### To Test:

```sh
dotnet test ./Tests/Tests.csproj
```

### To Run:

```sh
dotnet run -p ./App/App.csproj
```


### To check coverage:
```sh
npm run coverage
```

/ while in root dir of project.
